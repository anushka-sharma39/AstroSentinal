prototype orbital collision risk monitoring system

Problem
Space debris and increasing satellite traffic create collision risks in low Earth orbit. Current monitoring systems are complex and not accessible for simplified academic modeling.

Solution
AstroSentinel is a prototype system that:

1.Simulates satellite positional data

2.Calculates proximity-based collision risk

3.Visualizes risk levels on a web dashboard

Features

Collision Risk Detection Engine

Risk Visualization Dashboard

Alert Trigger System

Tech Stack-
Python
Flask
HTML/CSS
Basic ML / Rule-based logic

Implementation Plan
Phase 1 – Data Simulation
Phase 2 – Risk Calculation Logic
Phase 3 – Web Dashboard
Phase 4 – Testing & Optimization

Future Scope

Integration with real orbital datasets

Habitability prediction models

 open-source data integration
